# Employee Attrition Analysis
In the contemporary business landscape, employee attrition has evolved into a significant concern for maintaining a company's competitive edge. The process of finding, hiring, and training new talent is considerably costly. On the other hand, retaining existing employees proves to be more cost-effective. To achieve this, fostering a positive working environment becomes crucial in encouraging employees to stay with the company long-term. While in the past, this was managed manually, the present era is characterized by the integration of machine learning and data analytics. Nowadays, companies leverage data analytics tools within their HR departments to pinpoint areas that require modification, ensuring maximum employee retention.
